# Learning Go

Set of simple mini projects to learn Go language. I'll mostly follow the
tutorials from the go.dev site, but I'll change the final code a bit as I'm
playing along with it, and I'll add comments in it to keep track of my though process. 

I'm also planning to introduce some Google Cloud based projects to ship my code
into the cloud. This will most surely going to be serverless services as I'm currently
working with them, but we'll see. 

Please, **do not expect fully optimized, ready-for-production code**. This is a playground
for me to get to know and feel more comfortable with the language, exploring features
that otherwise I wouldn't be able to explore within of my working tasks.
